###Data structure to abstract the data
server.h:
```C 
typedef struct redisObject {
    unsigned type:4; /* 0,1,2,3,4 represents string,list,set,zset,hash,align to 1 byte */
    unsigned encoding:4; /* String or hashing can be represented in different way */
    unsigned lru:LRU_BITS; /* lru time (relative to server.lruclock) */
    int refcount;
    void *ptr;
} robj;
```
The most important function of expiring the key is int expireIfNeeded and getExpire functions in db.c file.

```C
long long getExpire(redisDb *db, robj *key) {
    dictEntry *de;

    /* No expire? return ASAP */
    if (dictSize(db->expires) == 0 ||
       (de = dictFind(db->expires,key->ptr)) == NULL) return -1;

    /* The entry was found in the expire dict, this means it should also
     * be present in the main dict (safety check). */
    serverAssertWithInfo(NULL,key,dictFind(db->dict,key->ptr) != NULL);
    return dictGetSignedIntegerVal(de);
}
```
```C
int expireIfNeeded(redisDb *db, robj *key) {
    mstime_t when = getExpire(db,key);
    mstime_t now;

    if (when < 0) return 0; /* No expire for this key */

    /* Don't expire anything while loading. It will be done later. */
    if (server.loading) return 0;

    /* If we are in the context of a Lua script, we claim that time is
     * blocked to when the Lua script started. This way a key can expire
     * only the first time it is accessed and not in the middle of the
     * script execution, making propagation to slaves / AOF consistent.
     * See issue #1525 on Github for more information. */
    now = server.lua_caller ? server.lua_time_start : mstime();

    /* If we are running in the context of a slave, return ASAP:
     * the slave key expiration is controlled by the master that will
     * send us synthesized DEL operations for expired keys.
     *
     * Still we try to return the right information to the caller,
     * that is, 0 if we think the key should be still valid, 1 if
     * we think the key is expired at this time. */
    if (server.masterhost != NULL) return now > when;

    /* Return when this key has not expired */
    if (now <= when) return 0;

    /* Delete the key */
    server.stat_expiredkeys++;
    propagateExpire(db,key,server.lazyfree_lazy_expire);
    notifyKeyspaceEvent(NOTIFY_EXPIRED,
        "expired",key,db->id);
    return server.lazyfree_lazy_expire ? dbAsyncDelete(db,key) :
                                         dbSyncDelete(db,key);
}
```
